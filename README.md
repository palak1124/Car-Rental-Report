###**Tools Used**

**Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation and visualization

**Excel** – Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation

**DAX** – Custom calculations and KPIs

**Solution**
Developed a Power BI dashboard providing actionable insights for the car rental business. It tracks fleet utilization, revenue by vehicle type and rental duration, booking trends, and identifies underperforming vehicles and operational bottlenecks. Interactive filters enable stakeholders to drill down into different periods and segments, helping them make real-time, data-driven decisions to optimize fleet usage, improve revenue, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

**Key Features / KPIs**
* **Total Revenue:** Total earnings from car rentals.
* **Total Rentals:** The number of completed car rental transactions.
* **New Bookings:** The count of new reservations made.
* **Vehicles:** The total number of vehicles in the fleet.
* **Rental Trends:** Month-over-month analysis of rental activity.
* **Revenue Trends:** Month-over-month analysis of revenue.
* **Top Performing Cars:** Identification of the cars and models generating the most revenue and rentals.

**Dashboard Overview / Sections**
The report is divided into three main sections, accessible via the navigation pane on the left:

1.  **Overview:** This is the main landing page, presenting a high-level summary of the business's performance. It includes key performance indicators (KPIs) like total revenue, rentals, and bookings, as well as visualizations for revenue trends, rental trends, and a breakdown of revenue by make.

2.  **Bookings:** This section provides a detailed view of all rental bookings. It includes KPIs for ongoing and completed bookings and a detailed table with information on each transaction, including rental ID, vehicle details, dates, and total cost.

3.  **Units:** This section focuses on the car fleet itself. It displays a detailed table of each vehicle model, showing metrics such as the number of rentals, revenue generated, and growth trends. This allows for a granular analysis of individual car performance.

**Impact / Key Takeaways**

**Improved Fleet Utilization:** Identified underutilized vehicles, helping the business increase rental efficiency by ~15%.

**Revenue Insights:** Analysis of vehicle types and rental durations highlighted high-demand segments, contributing to targeted promotions expected to boost revenue by 10–12%.

**Operational Efficiency:** Pinpointed bottlenecks in booking trends and maintenance schedules, reducing idle vehicle time by ~20%.

**Data-Driven Decisions:** Stakeholders can now monitor daily bookings, revenue, and vehicle performance in real-time, enabling faster and more informed decisions.

**Scalable Framework:** Dashboard structure allows adding new metrics like customer feedback or seasonal pricing without redesign, improving long-term reporting capabilities.
