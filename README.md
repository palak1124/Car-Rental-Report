### **Data Sources**
The data for this dashboard is sourced from a fictional car rental database, including information on bookings, vehicle details, revenue, and customer interactions.

### **Key Features / KPIs**
* **Total Revenue:** Total earnings from car rentals.
* **Total Rentals:** The number of completed car rental transactions.
* **New Bookings:** The count of new reservations made.
* **Vehicles:** The total number of vehicles in the fleet.
* **Rental Trends:** Month-over-month analysis of rental activity.
* **Revenue Trends:** Month-over-month analysis of revenue.
* **Top Performing Cars:** Identification of the cars and models generating the most revenue and rentals.
* **Rental Status:** Breakdown of completed, ongoing, and upcoming bookings.

### **Dashboard Overview / Sections**
The report is divided into three main sections, accessible via the navigation pane on the left:

1.  **Overview:** This is the main landing page, presenting a high-level summary of the business's performance. It includes key performance indicators (KPIs) like total revenue, rentals, and bookings, as well as visualizations for revenue trends, rental trends, and a breakdown of revenue by make.

2.  **Bookings:** This section provides a detailed view of all rental bookings. It includes KPIs for ongoing and completed bookings and a detailed table with information on each transaction, including rental ID, vehicle details, dates, and total cost.

3.  **Units:** This section focuses on the car fleet itself. It displays a detailed table of each vehicle model, showing metrics such as the number of rentals, revenue generated, and growth trends. This allows for a granular analysis of individual car performance.

### **How to Use / Interact with the Dashboard**
* **Navigation:** Use the **Overview**, **Bookings**, and **Units** buttons on the left to switch between the different report pages.
* **Filters:** Use the filters at the top and right of the dashboard to slice the data by various categories, such as car make or model.
* **Hover and Click:** Hover over visuals to see tooltips with specific data points. Click on elements within charts (e.g., a specific car make on a bar chart) to cross-filter the entire page and focus on that data.

### **Insights / Findings**
* Revenue and new bookings have shown a significant decrease in the latest month, with revenue down by 31% and new bookings down by 67%.
* The **Audi Q7** is the top-performing vehicle, generating the highest revenue.
* Rental activity shows seasonal fluctuations, with December experiencing a sharp decline.
* Audi and Ford are the top two vehicle makes in terms of revenue contribution.

### **Recommendations**
Based on the dashboard's findings, here are some recommendations for the business:
* **Investigate the recent decline:** Analyze the reasons behind the significant drop in revenue and new bookings in the past month to identify potential issues, such as market changes, competitor activity, or a shift in customer behavior.
* **Optimize the fleet:** Given the strong performance of the Audi Q7, consider expanding the fleet with more high-demand models. Conversely, analyze the performance of lower-revenue models to determine if they should be replaced or retired.
* **Target marketing efforts:** Focus marketing campaigns on top-performing car brands and models to capitalize on existing demand. Additionally, create targeted promotions to boost rentals during historically low-performing months, like December.
